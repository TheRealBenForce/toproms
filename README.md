# toproms
The goal of this repo is to trim large rom collections into only the most 
popular for each console and also to improve on my understanding of object
oriented programming.

I plan to collect rom lists using the IGDB api and sorted by the "popularity"
attribute and compare it to existing rom collections. This will be fun too
because I get to experiment with fuzzy searching.
